## 🛠️ Method Overview

FreeInpaint is a plug-and-play tuning-free approach for image inpainting that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step.

## ✅ TODO
### Code
- [x] Evaluation and Pipeline of BrushNet
- [x] Pipeline of Others (SDI, SDXLI, SD3I, PPT)
- [ ] Evaluation of Others (SDI, SDXLI, SD3I, PPT)
### Results
- [x] Results on our machine

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Environment Requirement 🌍

Freeinpaint has been implemented and tested on Pytorch 2.0.1 with python 3.9.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/CharlesGong12/FreeInpaint.git
```

We recommend you first use `conda` to create virtual environment, and install `pytorch` following [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/). For example:


```
conda create -n freeinpaint python=3.9 -y
conda activate freeinpaint
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2
```

Then, you can enter this repo and install diffusers (implemented in this repo) with:

```
pip install -e .
```

After that, you can install required packages thourgh:

```
cd examples/freeinpaint/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download ⬇️

**Dataset**
If you want to run the evaluation in our paper, you need to download and process the [COCO 2017 Validation images](https://cocodataset.org/#download) and [EditBench](https://imagen.research.google/editor/). The COCO re-annotation is located at `examples/freeinpaint/anno/llava-next_annotations_val2017.jsonl`.

**Checkpoints**

FreeInpaint is training-free; you need to download the model you want to apply, such as [stable-diffusion-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-inpainting), [stable-diffusion-xl-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1), [BrushNet-Random-Mask](https://github.com/TencentARC/BrushNet), [PowerPaint](https://huggingface.co/JunhaoZhuang/PowerPaint-v1), [SD3-Controlnet-Inpainting](https://huggingface.co/alimama-creative/SD3-Controlnet-Inpainting).

## 🖥️ Gradio Demo (Interactive App)

You can try FreeInpaint interactively with the provided Gradio app:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will launch at `http://localhost:7860`. You can:
- Upload an image and **draw a mask** (white brush) on the area to inpaint.
- Enter a text prompt describing what to generate.
- Optionally enable FreeInpaint reward-guided optimisation by providing reward model paths.

To pre-load a model at startup and create a public share link:

```bash
python app.py \
    --model stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-inpainting \
    --share
```

To use a locally downloaded model:

```bash
python app.py --model /path/to/stable-diffusion-inpainting
```

## 🏃🏼 Running Scripts

Our code is in `examples/freeinpaint/`. We have now open-sourced the pipeline code for all base models integrated with FreeInpaint, as well as the evaluation code for BrushNet.

You can evaluate BrushNet using the script:

```
python examples/freeinpaint/eval/eval_brushnet_otherbench_optno_guidance.py \
    --brushnet_ckpt_path random_mask_brushnet_ckpt_path \
    --base_model_path realisticVisionV60B1_v51VAE_path \
    --data_dir editbench_path \
    --image_save_path ./outputs/BrushNet-OptNoGuidance/editbench \
    --use_prompt_mask \
    --clip_model_name_or_path openai-clip-vit-large-patch14_path \
    --image_reward_model_name_or_path your_path \
    --pick_processor_name_or_path your_path \
    --pick_model_name_or_path your_path \
    --inpaint_reward_config_path your_path \
    --inpaint_reward_model_path your_path \
    --reward_guidance_scale 25 \
    --overall_reward_scale 0.1 \
    --prompt_reward_scale 4 \
    --harmonic_reward_scale 1 \
    --self_attn_loss_scale 5 \
    --max_round_initno 5 \
    --opt_noise_steps 40 \
    --use_prompt_mask \
```

You need to use your own paths. The `--use_prompt_mask` indicates using prompts that describe the inpainting regions.

#### Note

1. We find different machine may generate different images, thus providing the results on our machine [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c6LAjSduCkiMX6LpAymIGEEwHdhq8Q-m?usp=sharing).

2. Currently, we have provided the evaluation code for BrushNet. You can refer to and modify the code for other models yourself. We will provide the evaluation code for other models soon.

3. This repository is based on BrushNet, so stable-diffusion-inpainting, stable-diffusion-xl-inpainting, and BrushNet can be run directly. Other pipeline code that cannot be run directly is also provided: if you want to run PowerPaint, since the code repositories are different, you can move `examples/freeinpaint/pipe/pipeline_PowerPaint_optno_guidance.py` to your PowerPaint code path; if you want to run SD3-Controlnet-Inpainting, due to significant differences in environment configurations, you need to update the `diffusers` library.

4. Following [selfcross-guidance](https://github.com/mengtang-lab/selfcross-guidance), the features of the intermediate layers of SD3, layers 7-17, are used during evaluation.
